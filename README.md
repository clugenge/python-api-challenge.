# python-api-challenge.
This project consists of using python, APIs, and JSON to answer questions that are: What is the weather like as we approach the equator? and finding hotels in each city based on the ideal weather.This challenge uses weathers API and the Geofinder API Program  
AskBCS helped me with any errors in running the code when output imagines did not load, by helping me install libraries I didnt have.

Just to note that my DataFrame is consistently showing "No hotel found" for all cities, it might indicate that there are no hotels within a 10,000-meter radius of the coordinates I provided for each city. In some rural or less densely populated areas, it's possible that there are no hotels within the specified radius, and in such cases, "No hotel found" ca be the result.
