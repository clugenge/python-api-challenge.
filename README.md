This project consists of using python, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer questions that are: What is the weather like as we approach the equator? and finding hotels in each city based on the ideal weather.This challenge uses weathers API and the Geofinder API Program  
AskBCS helped me with any errors in running the code when output imagines did not load, by helping me install libraries I didnt have.
